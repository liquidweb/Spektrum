# Contributing

Spektrum is a Python testing framework inspired by RSpec and Jasmine. Contributions are
welcome — this file covers how to get one reviewed.

## Development setup

```shell
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

Build, test and lint commands are listed in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#commands) and not
repeated here.

## Spektrum is a library

A defect here does not fail one test. It changes what every suite built on Spektrum
reports, and every consumer picks it up at once. [openspec/project.md](openspec/project.md)
is the full working agreement — the red-then-green rule, scope discipline, and the
reporter compatibility contract. Read it before opening a PR.

The short version:

- **Prove the change.** A behavioural change needs a test that fails without it and passes
  with it. Put both counts in the PR.
- **Run both suites.** `tests/` has a pytest suite *and* a suite of Spektrum specs that
  pytest does not collect. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#two-suites-and-neither-runs-the-other).
- **Keep the diff to the change.** Pre-existing problems in a file you touched are worth
  reporting, not worth widening the diff for. Don't reformat existing code.

## Opening a PR

A pull request description carries the change information and the output from your test
run. Nothing else — no template to fill in, no sections to delete because they do not apply.
Link the ticket, say what changed, and paste what you ran and what it printed.
Base branch is `master`.

## Before you open a PR

- [ ] `python -m pytest tests -q` passes — record the count
- [ ] `python -m spektrum -s tests/live/` passes — record the count. A failing case does
      exit 1, but a **nonexistent search path** exits 0 under `python -m` (the `spektrum`
      console script exits 1 there), so a typo'd path looks like success
- [ ] `tox -e flake8` is clean (max line length 100)
- [ ] A test proves the change: observed failing before, passing after
- [ ] Docs (`README.rst`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/`) updated if this changes how the project is
      built, run, or used
- [ ] Squashed to a single commit, with the evidence above folded into the message body.
      Work in as many commits as you like locally; a PR is one commit. This is a shared
      convention across our repositories, not a preference local to this one
